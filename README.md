## About

The Preprocessed isolation forest (PiForest) algorithm is a method for detecting outliers in streaming data for resource constrained environment. PiForest offers a number of features that many competing anomaly detection algorithms lack. Specifically, PiForest:

- Is designed to handle streaming data.
- Performs well in resource constrained environment.
- Performs well on high-dimensional data.
- Reduces the influence of irrelevant dimensions.
- Features an anomaly-scoring algorithm with a clear underlying statistical meaning.

This repository provides an open-source implementation of the PiForest algorithm and its core data structures for the purposes of facilitating experimentation and enabling future extensions of the PiForest algorithm.

## Documentation

Read the docs [here üìñ](https://www.piforest.ml/).

## Installation

Download the repo, and run the main file.
Currently, only Python 3 is supported.

### Dependencies

The following dependencies are *required* to install and use `PiForest`:

-numpy==1.19.2
-pandas==1.1.3
-scikit_multiflow==0.5.3
-scikit_learn==0.24.2


Listed version numbers have been tested and are known to work (this does not necessarily preclude older versions).
